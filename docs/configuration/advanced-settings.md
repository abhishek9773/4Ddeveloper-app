   - [Provide information on the purpose and impact of this setting.]
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     # Example configuration for Setting Name 1
     setting_name_1: true
     ```

2. **[Setting Name 2]:**

   - [Explain the purpose and potential use cases for this setting.]
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     # Example configuration for Setting Name 2
     setting_name_2: value
     ```

3. **[Setting Name 3]:**
   - [Describe any dependencies or interactions with other settings.]
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     # Example configuration for Setting Name 3
     setting_name_3: false
     ```

Feel free to experiment with these advanced settings to tailor the app to your specific needs. As always, restart the app after making changes for them to take effect.
